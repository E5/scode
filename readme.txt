scode

A utility for storing snippets of SC code. Uses tags for categorising. All code,
tags and other information is stored in a big saveable Dictionary.

Each entry in the snippet table should contain these fields:

Title, Date, Author, Taglist, Snippet

There will be a separate tags table that updates a list of all tags as they are
added. This will enable the user to add a tag without necessarily assigning it
to a snippet.
